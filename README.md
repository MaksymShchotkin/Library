Library Management System is a work-in-progress application, designed for practice in creating a Spring Boot application.
App is curently missing a better half of a mapping and has inconcistencies in workflow and violation of key design practices.
All of the flows will be elliminated until Library Management System becomes a standalone web application.

To access app launch LibrarySystemApplication.java and go to the http://localhost:8080/books in your browser. 
Most of functionality have yet to be mapped and realised through client, yet it's being tested.
